        "\n",
        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "This report investigates the prediction of startup closures using a classification model. The task is to determine whether a startup will close (label 0) or remain operational (label 1) based on historical and categorical data. The model is evaluated for its strengths, limitations, and potential improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Predicting startup outcomes is critical for investors, entrepreneurs, and policy-makers. By understanding the patterns and drivers of startup success or failure, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights for decision-making and improve the model's predictive capabilities.\n",

        "1. **Lifetime**: The duration a startup has been operational is the strongest predictor of closure.\n",
        "2. **Days Since First Funding**: Startups that secure funding quickly tend to remain operational longer.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Dependence**:\n",
        "   - Heavy reliance on `Lifetime` and `Days Since First Funding` suggests the need for more diverse features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Threshold Bias**:\n",
        "   - The custom threshold prioritizes recall for operational startups, potentially reducing precision.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Optimize Hyperparameters**:\n",
        "   - Perform grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune the model's parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Experiment with Alternative Models**:\n",
        "   - Compare with Random Forest, Neural Networks, or Logistic Regression to validate performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Balance Precision and Recall**:\n",
        "   - Adjust thresholds to improve recall for closed startups without sacrificing precision for operational ones.\n",
